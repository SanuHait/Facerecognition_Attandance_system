# Face Recognition Attendance System

This project implements a Face Recognition Attendance System using Python. The system utilizes OpenCV and face recognition libraries to automate the attendance process based on facial recognition.

## Features

- Face recognition using Haar Cascade Classifier and deep learning-based models.
- Attendance tracking with timestamp.
- Real-time attendance marking.
- Easy integration with a database (optional for storing attendance data).

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- Face Recognition (`face_recognition`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- pandas (for attendance tracking)
  
You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python face_recognition numpy pandas
